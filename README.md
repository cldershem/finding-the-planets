# Finding the Planets
A workshop that allows one to discover exo-planets.

## Trappist-1
[Trappist-1][trappist] is a

> planetary system, located 12 parsecs away from the Solar system (39 light
> years), near the ecliptic, within the constellation of Aquarius. 

Trappist-1 appeared in the news because it was [announced][press-release] that
is orbited by at least seven planets. 

## Workshop
During this workshop you will discover the planets around Trappist-1 on your
own.

We will find the planets with data made available by
NASA's [K2/Kepler telescope][K2]. The mission is

> search for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars

The [Trappist-1 data][data] is publicly accessible. [Geert Barentsen][barentsen]
has made some interesting tools to analyze the data. 

## Results
### Images
#### First image created
Below you find the first image that I created from the *long cadence* FITS data.
To me it is still amazing that from a series of these 11 by 11 images one can
obtain so much information.

#### Collage
There are 3599 such images which fit nicely into a 61 times 59 rectangle.
Starring at the image you could start to notice certain peculiarities. Which do
you see? 

![Collage made the number of images is 61*59](https://cdn.rawgit.com/fifth-postulate/finding-the-planets/fd091991ad956f572d583f902b635a572d509968/java/src/main/resources/collage.png)

### Average
The average brightness, as can be seen from the collage, seems to steadily increase.
