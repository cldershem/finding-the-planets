# Collage
In this chapter we will create a Collage of all the image in the long cadence
file. Although it is a bit of a side-track, we will learn valuable things by
looking at the image.

If you want, you can take a [sneak peek](image/collage.png).

We will not go into details of reading the data and writing the transformed
data. We assume that the previous chapters have given enough examples to learn
from. Instead we are going to focus on processing the data.
