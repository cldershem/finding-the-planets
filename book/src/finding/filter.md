Take a look the brightness graph you made in the preceding chapter.

There are clear bands of data. I.e. regions where most of the data-points lie.
But what also stands out enormous
[outliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier). For example, most points are
below 18000, but some shoot out all the way to 28000. They are clearly
erroneous.

There are various reasons how these outliers can occur. Some are the results of
satellite maneuvers. What ever there origin, in this chapter we will filter
those outliers.
