# Exo-planet Discovery
How does on discover exo-planets? This is no small feat. It makes use of
advanced technology and often relies on extensive data analysis. Below we
outline the various different ways of discovering exoplanets.

The various ways can be grouped in two categories. Direct observation and
indirect observation.

## Direct observation
Direct observation entails taking an telescope and searching the sky in the hope
of spotting an exo-planet. Unfortunately the chances of this happening are very
low. Where we can take a telescope and point it at Jupiter and discover a few
of her moons, exo-planets are so far away and often so dim, it is impractical
for direct observation.

So we will quickly leave direct observation behind and look into indirect observation.

## Indirect observation
Indirect observation entails observing a star closely and inferring the
existence of one or more planets. It relies on the science orbital mechanics. We
don't have to become physicist to get a grasp of the mechanisms involved.

One of the [laws of planetary motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion) 
as laid down by Johannes Kepler is 

> The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.

This is not entirely true. Isaac Newton, when writing down his laws of
gravitational attraction, inferred that planets and their stars revolve around
their _center of mass_.

This motion lets stars wobble around their average position. And it is this
wobble that we can use to infer the existence of planets.
