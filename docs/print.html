<p>This book is an compendium to the workshop <em>Find Planets</em>. The workshop walks
you through various techniques and teaches you how to detect planets in
photo-metric data.</p>
<p>It starts with observations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1">Trappist-1</a>, a star system only 40
light-years from earth. It ends with finding the planets among the massaged
data. Along the way you learn how to clean up data, what we are looking for, and
how to find the actual planets.</p>
<p>This book challenges you to become a planet-hunter yourself. Together you and
your trusty silicon companion go on a journey to explore the riches of the
universe. So put on your science hat and go find those planets.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#background" id="background"><h1>Background</h1></a>
<p>Before we strap into our science-craft let's to set the scene by learning about
the background of all those marvelous discoveries.</p>
<p>In the following chapters, you will learn more about Trappist-1, how it was
discovered and the data that we will use to find its planets.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#trappist-1" id="trappist-1"><h1>Trappist-1</h1></a>
<p>Trappist-1 is a star system 39 light-years from Earth. A light-year is the
distance light travels in on year. That is approximately 369 trillion
kilometers. Even though this seems an astronomically large distance, on a
galactic scale, Trappist-1 and the sun are close neighbors.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#kepler spacecraft" id="kepler spacecraft"><h1>Kepler Spacecraft</h1></a>
<p>The Kepler spacecraft is a satellite that orbits the sun and acts as an
telescope observing the universe without earths atmosphere interfering.</p>
<p>It was launched by NASA, as part of the Discovery Program. A program which
focused on a series of lower-cost, highly focused space missions.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#science" id="science"><h1>Science</h1></a>
<p>In this part we will explore the science behind exo-planet discovery. We will
detail the different methods of detecting exo-planets, and do some calculations
on what the expect.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#exo-planet discovery" id="exo-planet discovery"><h1>Exo-planet Discovery</h1></a>
<p>How does on discover exo-planets? This is no small feat. It makes use of
advanced technology and often relies on extensive data analysis. Below we
outline the various different ways of discovering exoplanets.</p>
<p>The various ways can be grouped in two categories. Direct observation and
indirect observation.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#direct observation" id="direct observation"><h2>Direct observation</h2></a>
<p>Direct observation entails taking an telescope and searching the sky in the hope
of spotting an exo-planet. Unfortunately the chances of this happening are very
low. Where we can take a telescope and point it at Jupiter and discover a few
of her moons, exo-planets are so far away and often so dim, it is impractical
for direct observation.</p>
<p>So we will quickly leave direct observation behind and look into indirect observation.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#indirect observation" id="indirect observation"><h2>Indirect observation</h2></a>
<p>Indirect observation entails observing a star closely and inferring the
existence of one or more planets. It relies on the science orbital mechanics. We
don't have to become physicist to get a grasp of the mechanisms involved.</p>
<p>One of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion">laws of planetary motion</a>
as laid down by Johannes Kepler is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not entirely true. Isaac Newton, when writing down his laws of
gravitational attraction, inferred that planets and their stars revolve around
their <em>center of mass</em>.</p>
<p>This motion lets stars wobble around their average position. And it is this
wobble that we can use to infer the existence of planets.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#observing position" id="observing position"><h1>Observing Position</h1></a>
<p>Similar with direct observation, we could try to observe the wobble of a star
directly. This method faces the same problems, i.e. the distances of the stars
are so immense, the wobble becomes all but undetectable.</p>
<p>So we will quickly move on the other methods.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#doppler effect" id="doppler effect"><h1>Doppler Effect</h1></a>
<p>Just like a blaring whistle of a train drops pitch when it rushes by, light
changes color when depending if the light emitter is moving towards us or away
from us. This is called the Doppler effect.</p>
<p>By careful measurement of the Doppler effect in star light one could discover
regularities and infer the existence of planets. Even though this technique is
used to discover exo-planets, we will be making use of a different technique.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#transit method" id="transit method"><h1>Transit Method</h1></a>
<p>When a planet moves in between its star and the Earth, it will make the star
appear dimmer because it obscures some of the light rays. Despite that planets
are often very much smaller than their companion star, this effect is certainly
measurable.</p>
<p>It is the transit method that we will use in this workshop to detect the planets
around Trappist-1.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#what to look for" id="what to look for"><h1>What To Look For</h1></a>
<p>We are forming a model of a planet transit in order to make some calculations
what to expect. Our model will be fairly crude, but it will suffices for
understanding key characteristics of light curves.</p>
<p>This section has some math in it. It is used to understand how a light curve
will look when a planet transits. Feel free to skip to the result if you feel
inclined.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#light curve" id="light curve"><h2>Light Curve</h2></a>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_curve">light curve</a> is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a graph of light intensity of a celestial object or region, as a function of
time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It graphs how bright some object appears in the sky over time. Our goal is to
understand how the light curve looks like when a planet transits a star.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#model" id="model"><h2>Model</h2></a>
<p>We are modeling our planet transit in the following crude manner. We assume the
star to be a square which radiates uniformly. The total luminosity is
\(I_{0}\). So the luminosity per area \(\rho = \frac{I_{0}}{A}\), where \(A\)
is the total area of the star.</p>
<p>We model our planet as a square as well. We will also assume that the planet
will move with uniform speed across stars image during the transit. When the
planet is fully in front of the star, it block some of the rays of the star
diminishing the luminosity to \(I_{t} = \rho \left(A - a\right)\), where
\(a\) is the area of the planet.</p>
<p>The interested in the relative drop in luminosity so we will divide \(I_{t}\)
by \(I_{0}\) to get</p>
<p>\[
\frac{I_{t}}{I_{0}} = \frac{\rho \left(A - a\right)}{\rho A} = 1 - \frac{a}{A}
\]</p>
<p>So the entire light curve looks something like this.</p>
<p><img src="image/light-curve.png" alt="A light curve for a planet transition" /></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#finding planets" id="finding planets"><h1>Finding Planets</h1></a>
<p>The following chapters will guide you in writing software that will detects
planets around Trappist-1.</p>
<p>Two things will go hand in hand. Explaining what to do followed by you
implementing that in your favorite programming language.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#fits" id="fits"><h1>FITS</h1></a>
<p>The results of the NASA Kepler mission on observing Trappist-1 are
<a href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/raw-data-for-k2-campaign-12-and-trappist-1-now-available.html">available</a>
to the public. For your ease of use we downloaded the FITS files before hand.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#what are fits files" id="what are fits files"><h2>What are FITS files</h2></a>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS">FITS</a> file is a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>open standard defining a digital file format useful for storage,
transmission and processing of scientific and other images. FITS is the most
commonly used digital file format in astronomy. Unlike many image formats,
FITS is designed specifically for scientific data and hence includes many
provisions for describing photometric and spatial calibration information,
together with image origin metadata.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are going to use the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/fits-rs">fits-rs</a> crate to
process the FITS files.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#csv" id="csv"><h1>CSV</h1></a>
<p>In this chapter we will read the FITS file and export the actual image as comma
seperated values (CSV).</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#image" id="image"><h1>Image</h1></a>
<p>Now that we have are data in a CSV file, we are operating on it. The first thing
that we should do is make an image.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#artist impression" id="artist impression"><h2>Artist Impression</h2></a>
<p><img src="image/artist-impression.jpg" alt="An artist impression of Trappist-1" /></p>
<p>Often artists are commissioned to create a stunning visualization of new findings.
This is also the case with the Trappist-1 news. Above you find an artist
impression of Trappist-1.</p>
<p>The downside of this is that we could loose track of the actual data that is
used. In order to get a sense of awe for the search of exo-planets, we are
creating our own impression.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating an image" id="creating an image"><h2>Creating an image</h2></a>
<p>The following outline is typical for almost all the activities we are going to
do in this workshop.</p>
<ol>
<li>Read data</li>
<li>Process data</li>
<li>Write data</li>
</ol>
<p>Processing could be any of, but not limited to, transforming, filtering,
analyzing or fitting. Now processing will be generating image data.</p>
<p>Because this could be your first encounter with the libraries we use, we are
going to be very specific. In a sense the training wheels are on. But once you
created your own image, you are ready to following your own path.</p>
<p>So go ahead and start a new Rust file named <code>image.rs</code> in the <code>src/bin</code>
directory of your project.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#reading data" id="reading data"><h3>Reading Data</h3></a>
<p>We will be reading our data from CSV. We will use the crate <code>simple_csv</code> for
that. In order to use it include the following lines in <code>image.rs</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
extern crate simple_csv;

use simple_csv::SimpleCsvReader;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>SimpleCsvReader</code> expects some sort of <code>BufReader</code>, a buffered reader. We
can create one from a <code>File</code>. So include the following modules.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::BufReader;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>And in the main function add.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let f = File::open(&quot;../long-cadence.csv&quot;).unwrap();
let buf = BufReader::new(f);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Notice that we are not handling errors in a graceful way. We are just going to
arrange everything correctly and hope for the best.</p>
<p>With the <code>buf</code> we can create a CSV reader and read the first row of our data.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let mut reader = SimpleCsvReader::new(buf);
let row = reader.next_row().unwrap.unwrap();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The unsightly double <code>unwrap</code> at the end comes from the interplay of the
<code>Iterator</code> trait that has a <code>next</code> function that returns an <code>Option</code>, and the
way <code>simple_csv</code> parses lines in CSV files. Don't worry about it now, just make
a mental note.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#processing data" id="processing data"><h3>Processing Data</h3></a>
<p>Our CSV file contains rows of floating point numbers. But the <code>simple_csv</code> crate
returns a slice of Strings. We will need to turn does Strings into floating
point numbers before we can properly process them.</p>
<p>We does this by iterating over the <code>row</code>. Remember how the first column
contained the time? We don't need it now so we will drop it for the moment.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let mut iter = row.iter();
iter.next(); // dropping time
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Next we can transform all the measurements in floating point numbers.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let raw: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = iter
    .map(|s| f64::from_str(s).unwrap())
    .collect();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>For the preceding line to work we need to include a <code>use std::str::FromStr;</code>
line at the top of our file.</p>
<p>What we are going to do is map these measurements onto a gray scale that we can
save as an image. We do this by determining the maximum measurement, determining
the relative measurement compared to the maximum, and scaling it the an integer
range from 0 to 255.</p>
<p>The following lines achieve this.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let maximum = raw
    .iter()
    .fold(std::f64::MIN, |acc, v| acc.max(*v));
let data: Vec&lt;u8&gt; = raw
    .iter()
    .map(|s| s/maximum)
    .map(|s| 255.0 * s)
    .map(|s| s.floor() as u8)
    .collect();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#writing data" id="writing data"><h2>Writing data</h2></a>
<p>Now that we have the gray-scale data, it is time to write it as an image. For
this we will use the <code>png</code> crate. Before we can use it add</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
extern crate png;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>To the top of the source file. We also need to include an import statement that
makes our live working with PNGs easier.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use png:HasParameters;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We are going to save the PNG into our working directory. Because the <code>png</code> crate
expects a <code>BufWriter</code> we will have to include the following modules.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::env;
use std::io::{BufWriter, BufReader};
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Notice that we already had imported the <code>BufReader</code> module. With these imports
we can create a <code>BufWriter</code> in one fell swoop.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let mut path = env::current_dir().unwrap();
path.push(format!(&quot;trappist-1.{}.png&quot;, 0));
let file = File::create(path).unwrap();
let ref mut w = BufWriter::new(file);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Now we can hand over this <code>BufWriter</code> to a PNG <code>Encoder</code>, configure it to our
liking, create a PNG <code>Writer</code> and write the data.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let mut encoder = png::Encoder::new(w, 11, 11);
encoder.set(png::ColorType::Grayscale).set(png::BitDepth::Eight);
let mut writer = encoder.write_header().unwrap();
writer.write_image_data(data.as_slice()).unwrap();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#our image" id="our image"><h2>Our Image</h2></a>
<p>It is finally time to make our own impression of Trappist-1. Use <code>cargo</code> to
build and run your code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">&gt; cargo build
&gt; cargo run --bin image
</code></pre>
<p>Which creates</p>
<p><img src="image/trappist-1.0.png" alt="Actual Trappist-1 photo" /></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#appreciate the image" id="appreciate the image"><h2>Appreciate the Image</h2></a>
<p>At first glance the image can be a little underwhelming. But it is precisely
this image that blew my mind! Being accustomed to the marvelous artist
impression when I learned about the actual data was 11x11 pixels I was hooked.
How could anyone extract so much information from so little data?</p>
<p><img src="image/trappist-1.0.large.png" alt="10 times enlargement of actual Trappist-1 photo" /></p>
<p>I had to know and I hope you want to know too!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#further considerations" id="further considerations"><h2>Further Considerations</h2></a>
<p>Almost every chapter can be allows you to play with what you have created. Below
you can find some suggestions and food for thought that my spark your
interested.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a bigger image with larger &quot;pixels&quot;.</li>
<li>Make an entire series of images, one for each row.</li>
<li>Make a GIF or movie of the images.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#collage" id="collage"><h1>Collage</h1></a>
<p>In this chapter we will create a Collage of all the image in the long cadence
file. Although it is a bit of a side-track, we will learn valuable things by
looking at the image.</p>
<p>If you want, you can take a <a href="image/collage.png">sneak peek</a>.</p>
<p>We will not go into details of reading the data and writing the transformed
data. We assume that the previous chapters have given enough examples to learn
from. Instead we are going to focus on processing the data.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#setup" id="setup"><h1>Setup</h1></a>
<p>In this chapter we will setup everything so that you can start working on the
workshop.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#prerequisites" id="prerequisites"><h2>Prerequisites</h2></a>
<p>The only real prerequisite is that you have a working
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> tool chain. Everything else should be be
provided in the workshop resources.</p>
<p>If you want to graph some of the intermediate results, a graphing tool will be
useful. We would recommend <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">gnuplot</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#cargo_home" id="cargo_home"><h2>$CARGO_HOME</h2></a>
<p>The project does relies on some crates. In order to go easy on the conference
network we als downloaded the dependencies we envisioned. In order to make use
of this feature these downloaded crates it is necessary to set the <code>$CARGO_HOME</code>
environment variable to <code>&lt;PROJECT_RESOURCES&gt;/cargo_home</code>.</p>
