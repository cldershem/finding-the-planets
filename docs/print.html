<p>This book is an compendium to the workshop <em>Find Planets</em>. The workshop walks
you through various techniques and teaches you how to detect planets in
photo-metric data.</p>
<p>It starts with observations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1">Trappist-1</a>, a star system only 40
light-years from earth. It ends with finding the planets among the massaged
data. Along the way you learn how to clean up data, what we are looking for, and
how to find the actual planets.</p>
<p>This book challenges you to become a planet-hunter yourself. Together you and
your trusty silicon companion go on a journey to explore the riches of the
universe. So put on your science hat and go find those planets.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#background" id="background"><h1>Background</h1></a>
<p>Before we strap into our science-craft let's to set the scene by learning about
the background of all those marvelous discoveries.</p>
<p>In the following chapters, you will learn more about Trappist-1, how it was
discovered and the data that we will use to find its planets.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#trappist-1" id="trappist-1"><h1>Trappist-1</h1></a>
<p>Trappist-1 is a star system 39 light-years from Earth. A light-year is the
distance light travels in on year. That is approximately 369 trillion
kilometers. Even though this seems an astronomically large distance, on a
galactic scale, Trappist-1 and the sun are close neighbors.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#kepler spacecraft" id="kepler spacecraft"><h1>Kepler Spacecraft</h1></a>
<p>The Kepler spacecraft is a satellite that orbits the sun and acts as an
telescope observing the universe without earths atmosphere interfering.</p>
<p>It was launched by NASA, as part of the Discovery Program. A program which
focused on a series of lower-cost, highly focused space missions.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#science" id="science"><h1>Science</h1></a>
<p>In this part we will explore the science behind exo-planet discovery. We will
detail the different methods of detecting exo-planets, and do some calculations
on what the expect.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#exo-planet discovery" id="exo-planet discovery"><h1>Exo-planet Discovery</h1></a>
<p>How does on discover exo-planets? This is no small feat. It makes use of
advanced technology and often relies on extensive data analysis. Below we
outline the various different ways of discovering exoplanets.</p>
<p>The various ways can be grouped in two categories. Direct observation and
indirect observation.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#direct observation" id="direct observation"><h2>Direct observation</h2></a>
<p>Direct observation entails taking an telescope and searching the sky in the hope
of spotting an exo-planet. Unfortunately the chances of this happening are very
low. Where we can take a telescope and point it at Jupiter and discover a few
of her moons, exo-planets are so far away and often so dim, it is impractical
for direct observation.</p>
<p>So we will quickly leave direct observation behind and look into indirect observation.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#indirect observation" id="indirect observation"><h2>Indirect observation</h2></a>
<p>Indirect observation entails observing a star closely and inferring the
existence of one or more planets. It relies on the science orbital mechanics. We
don't have to become physicist to get a grasp of the mechanisms involved.</p>
<p>One of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion">laws of planetary motion</a>
as laid down by Johannes Kepler is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not entirely true. Isaac Newton, when writing down his laws of
gravitational attraction, inferred that planets and their stars revolve around
their <em>center of mass</em>.</p>
<p>This motion lets stars wobble around their average position. And it is this
wobble that we can use to infer the existence of planets.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#observing position" id="observing position"><h1>Observing Position</h1></a>
<p>Similar with direct observation, we could try to observe the wobble of a star
directly. This method faces the same problems, i.e. the distances of the stars
are so immense, the wobble becomes all but undetectable.</p>
<p>So we will quickly move on the other methods.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#doppler effect" id="doppler effect"><h1>Doppler Effect</h1></a>
<p>Just like a blaring whistle of a train drops pitch when it rushes by, light
changes color when depending if the light emitter is moving towards us or away
from us. This is called the Doppler effect.</p>
<p>By careful measurement of the Doppler effect in star light one could discover
regularities and infer the existence of planets. Even though this technique is
used to discover exo-planets, we will be making use of a different technique.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#transit method" id="transit method"><h1>Transit Method</h1></a>
<p>When a planet moves in between its star and the Earth, it will make the star
appear dimmer because it obscures some of the light rays. Despite that planets
are often very much smaller than their companion star, this effect is certainly
measurable.</p>
<p>It is the transit method that we will use in this workshop to detect the planets
around Trappist-1.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#what to look for" id="what to look for"><h1>What To Look For</h1></a>
<p>We are forming a model of a planet transit in order to make some calculations
what to expect. Our model will be fairly crude, but it will suffices for
understanding key characteristics of light curves.</p>
<p>This section has some math in it. It is used to understand how a light curve
will look when a planet transits. Feel free to skip to the result if you feel
inclined.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#light curve" id="light curve"><h2>Light Curve</h2></a>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_curve">light curve</a> is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a graph of light intensity of a celestial object or region, as a function of
time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It graphs how bright some object appears in the sky over time. Our goal is to
understand how the light curve looks like when a planet transits a star.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#model" id="model"><h2>Model</h2></a>
<p>We are modeling our planet transit in the following crude manner. We assume the
star to be a square which radiates uniformly. The total luminosity is
\(I_{0}\). So the luminosity per area \(\rho = \frac{I_{0}}{A}\), where \(A\)
is the total area of the star.</p>
<p>We model our planet as a square as well. We will also assume that the planet
will move with uniform speed across stars image during the transit. When the
planet is fully in front of the star, it block some of the rays of the star
diminishing the luminosity to \(I_{t} = \rho \left(A - a\right)\), where
\(a\) is the area of the planet.</p>
<p>The interested in the relative drop in luminosity so we will divide \(I_{t}\)
by \(I_{0}\) to get</p>
<p>\[
\frac{I_{t}}{I_{0}} = \frac{\rho \left(A - a\right)}{\rho A} = 1 - \frac{a}{A}
\]</p>
<p>So the entire light curve looks something like this.</p>

<p>The following chapters will guide you in writing software that will detects
planets around Trappist-1.</p>
<p>Two things will go hand in hand. Explaining what to do followed by you
implementing that in your favorite programming language.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#fits" id="fits"><h1>FITS</h1></a>
<p>The results of the NASA Kepler mission on observing Trappist-1 are
<a href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/raw-data-for-k2-campaign-12-and-trappist-1-now-available.html">available</a>
to the public. For your ease of use we downloaded the FITS files before hand.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#what are fits files" id="what are fits files"><h2>What are FITS files</h2></a>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS">FITS</a> file is a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>open standard defining a digital file format useful for storage,
transmission and processing of scientific and other images. FITS is the most
commonly used digital file format in astronomy. Unlike many image formats,
FITS is designed specifically for scientific data and hence includes many
provisions for describing photometric and spatial calibration information,
together with image origin metadata.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are going to use the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/fits-rs">fits-rs</a> crate to
process the FITS files.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#csv" id="csv"><h1>CSV</h1></a>
<p>In this chapter we will read the FITS file and export the actual image as comma
seperated values (CSV).</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#setup" id="setup"><h1>Setup</h1></a>
<p>In this chapter we will setup everything so that you can start working on the
workshop.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#prerequisites" id="prerequisites"><h2>Prerequisites</h2></a>
<p>The only real prerequisite is that you have a working
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> tool chain. Everything else should be be
provided in the workshop resources.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#cargo_home" id="cargo_home"><h2>$CARGO_HOME</h2></a>
<p>The project does relies on some crates. In order to go easy on the conference
network we als downloaded the dependencies we envisioned. In order to make use
of this feature these downloaded crates it is necessary to set the <code>$CARGO_HOME</code>
environment variable to <code>&lt;PROJECT_RESOURCES&gt;/cargo_home</code>.</p>
